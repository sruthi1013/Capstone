# Cancer Detection in Biopsy Images

## Problem Statement

Accurate prediction of a disease outcome is one of the most interesting and challenging tasks for physicians. The goal is to classify classify biopsy images of lymph node cross sections into Cancerous or Non-cancerous tumors. A positive prediction is made if the image contains at least 1 pixel of tumor tissue.



## Models Summary
- CNN Model with 1 Convolutional Layer: Accuracy = 0.85.
- CNN Model with 2 Convolutional Layers: Accuracy = 0.87.
- CNN Model with 4 Convolutional Layers: Accuracy = 0.91.



## CONCLUSIONS
1. Development of ML solutions in radiology/pathology is still in its infancy.
2. ML can identify cancer-related patterns in data that physicians may not, while physicians use reasoning and expertise not available to ML.
3. ML should be used as tools on top of a doctorâ€™s judgment.



## NEXT STEPS
1. Use industry standard models for medical image classification.
2. Work with other types of data for cancer diagnosis, such as X-Ray images or changes in Gene Sequences.
